`--multiple all` indicates that both tags `image` and `descr` accept multiple files. Without this option, the command
would fail, as the same key would be mapped to different files.

`--optional image` indicate that tag `image` is optional, allowing for group `c_b` to be kept even thoug it does not
have an image. Alternatively, one could use `--remove-on-missing` to remove groups without images from the final output.
Without any flag, the default is `--fail-on-missing all`, meaning that the command will fail if any of the tags is
absent.
