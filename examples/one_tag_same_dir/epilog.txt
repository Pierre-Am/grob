Additional things to note:

- since the pattern doesn't contain any named placehoder such as `{name}`, `grob` assumes the caller isn't interested in
the _keys_ of each group, and thus returns a list. This could be disabled by passing `--with-keys`.
- since the caller did not provide a tag, `grob` returns directly the path of the files, instead of wrapping them into
a dictionary. This could be disabled by passing `--no-squeeze`.
